## Problem Definition
To determine if movies are profitable mainly based off their budget

If movies profitability are affected by any other factors

## Models Used
1. Random Forest Model

2. Logistic Regression

## Conclusion
- We have concluded that that in order for a movie to be profitable, it has to reach a multiplier Revenue/Budget of 3.9x
- Profitability of a movie has a high correlation with regards to the budget, but other factors such as Cast/ Genre could affect
## What did we learn from this project?
- It is important to select a suitable model for the analysis of the question
- The various machine learning models and how to implement them

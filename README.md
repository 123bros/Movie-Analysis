# Movie-Analysis

## About
This a project for SC1015, it will mainly be focused on Movie Analysis obtained from [The Movie Database APIs](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Click on the following links below in order to verify source code

## Problem Definition
To determine if movies are profitable mainly based off their budget

If movies profitability are affected by any other factors

## Models Used
1. Random Forest Model

2. Logistic Regression / Gradient Boosting Regression

## Conclusion
- We have concluded that that in order for a movie to be profitable, it has to reach a multiplier of (Revenue/Budget) of 3.9x
- Profitability of a movie has a high correlation with regards to the budget but a low correlation to the ratings
- The revenue grossed also depends on a multitude of varaibles, mainly the genres/casts and whether the movie is part of a popular franchise
- There has been a huge increase in demand for movies, and as of now at least 90% of the movies are deemed profitiable from our model
- Going forward, we believe with a lower budget, it is easier to make a profit
- The tradeoff between increased budget for advertisement/cast comes with a expectation of a higher Revenue, otherwise, it will be unprofitable.

## What did we learn from this project?
- It is important to select a suitable model for the analysis of the question, as each model contains their Pros and Cons
- The various machine learning models and how to implement them
- Obtain dataset from different websites using API keys from TMDB movie database
- How to oraganise and use GitHub efficiently
- Understanding the importance of data cleaning and basic Exploratory Analysis 
- Accuracy of Machine Learning Models can be gradually improved over time with more data
- Anything can be visualised and anaylysed using Data Science methods
